Civilian evacuation efforts are ongoing, but some civilians might still remain in the area of operations."
      STR_PLANE_HIJACKING_BRIEFING: "Government entities have called us to deal with a plane hijacking. While negotiations with the perpetrators are ongoing, a peaceful resolution has been judged unlikely to happen and an assault has been ordered. Our Assault team will be approaching along the runway, trying to utilize the planes blind spots to get as close as possible while undetected. There are civilians inside the plane, so extreme care must be taken to avoid them getting hit in the crossfire."
      STR_HOUSE_RAID_BRIEFING: "Our Intelligence division has located a locale suspected to be used as a safehouse for a local terrorist cell and confirmed the presence of known suspects and their accomplishes.

      STR_HIDEOUT_RAID_BRIEFING: "Intelligence has discovered the main hideout of a terrorist cell. After careful preparation an assault has been authorized. The amount of suspects in the area is uncertain, but suspected to be large. The presence of heavy weaponry such as rocket launchers and machine guns has also been confirmed. The assault on the building will likely be perilous so precaution is advised."
      STR_OFFICE_RAID_BRIEFING: "After Local police were fired upon by private security when they were trying to seize documents for evidence we've been called in to raid the premises. Be warned, the private security forces are well equipped and trained, they should not be underestimated. Excessive firepower should be avoided as there is both civilians still located in the offices and vital evidence that must not be destroyed."
      STR_SKYSCRAPER_RAID_BRIEFING: "This is it, the headquarters of the shell company behind the funding of the terrorist cells. The skyscraper is filled to the brim with security forces and taking it will be a significant effort. Failure is not an option, the evidence required to find and convict those behind the attacks is in the building and we cannot afford to let it be destroyed."

      STR_MANHURIN_UFOPAEDIA: "A small revolver chambered in .38 Special. The Manhurin MR73 is carefully manufactured with many parts being hand-fitted. Despite its low capacity, it is favoured by the GIGN due to its reliability and accuracy."

      STR_SKORPION_UFOPAEDIA: "A machine pistol designed in Czechoslovakia as a sidearm for vehicle drivers and army staff, designed to be compact to fit into the limited space of armored vehicles. It saw wide use by many armed groups, both terrorist and criminal. "

      STR_TAVOR_UFOPAEDIA: "The IWI Tavor was designed for the IDF as a possible replacement to the M16. The weapons design prioritizes ease of maintenance, durability and reliability. Its bullpup design makes the rifle better suited to close quarters combat than rifles of conventional design."

      STR_FAMAS_UFOPAEDIA: "The FAMAS is the service rifle of the French military. Notable for its high fire rate, the FAMAS is known as le Clarion (the Bugle) by french troops due to its shape."
      STR_G36_UFOPAEDIA: "The Heckler & Koch G36 serves as the service rifle of the Bundeswehr. It has both an reflex sight and a telescopic sight with 3x magnification.

The FN MK 16, also known as the SCAR-L, chambered in 5.56 NATO was adopted by USSOCOM, but was shortly removed from service due to it not granting a large enough performance difference in comparison to other rifles to justify the purchase."
      STR_SCAR_H_UFOPAEDIA: "The FN MK 17, also known as the SCAR-H, chambered in 7.62 NATO has proved more popular than its lighter variant due to its relative light weight, exceptional accuracy and stopping power.

      STR_G11_UFOPAEDIA: "The Heckler & Koch G11 is an advanced assault rifle designed in the 1980s. It's design is intricate and complicated, containing innovations such as caseless ammunition not found in newer designs.

      STR_SR_3_UFOPAEDIA: "As a compact assault rifle, the SR-3 Vikhr saw use by russian special forces and government security details. Due to its relatively high cost, the rifle saw almost no use outside of Russia."
      STR_SR_3_ONE_HANDED_UFOPAEDIA: "When compacted to its smallest size the SR-3 could be used as a heavy sidearm. Though heavier than a pistol, the increased firepower might make up for it. It is not advised to fire the rifle in automatic mode while wielding it one handed as the recoil would be almost impossible to control."
      STR_M16A2_UFOPAEDIA: "The M16 was famously used by the US military during the vietnam war and has been the primary service rifle of the United States until the 21st century. While largely phased out by the military it is still an effective rifle. Notably the Rifle was designed not to have a fully automatic firing mode."
      STR_AR_18_UFOPAEDIA: "Designed as an alternative to the AR-15, the AR-18 saw extremely limited success, and wasn't adopted by any country as a standard service rifle. Infamously large number of AR-18:s were smuggled into Ireland to be used by the IRA, leading to the rifle to become an iconic symbol of the movement and gaining the nickname Widowmaker"

We suspect this location must be of great importance and therefore our intelligence officers have started to try and locate it."
      STR_SKYSCRAPER_RAID_UFOPAEDIA: "We've located what is believed to be the nerve center for the shell company behind this conspiracy, a office complex at the top of a skyscraper. Seizing it would not only serve significant blow to their operations but also provide a treasure trove of evidence. The operation will be the largest one we've undertaken, and will consist of two teams. One will be deployed on the roof while the other will approach from the bottom to cut of any escape."
