These palettes replace the standard xcom battlepedia pallete, and have the light purple colors swaped out for the gray text color used for the ufopaedia text.
CTO is the base palatte, SAFE has index 1 set to bright green, and TEST has the light purple colors that are swaped out set to bright green instead, so you can quickly see
if you are using them. 
To use the test pallet, go to Rulesets/UI.rul, find "type: PAL_UFOPAEDIA_CUSTOM" and under it should be a file path, change
that to the path for the test palette.
